# Targeted Transferable PES for n-alkanes

This is a targeted transferable potential energy surface (PES) for n-alkanes. It is based on the many-body permutationally invariant polynomial approach desecribed in Ref. [1], and is trained on ~250,000 C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>30</sub> energies computed at B3LYP/cc-pVDZ level of theory. It can be applied to linear alkanes, and its fidelity has been tested on alkanes from C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub> to C<sub>30</sub>H<sub>62</sub>
