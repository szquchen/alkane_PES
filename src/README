## bemsa*.f90 files
Containing permutationally invariant polynomials, used as basis functions in the PES


The key subroutines/functions are in pes_shell.f90, and briefly described below:
(1) pes_init(): reading in the linear coefficients. Must be called once before calling the potential
(2) subroutine getpot(x1d, pot): calculates the potential energy. x1d(3*natm) is the Cartesian coordinate in
    bohr, and the pot is the output, and the energy is in unit hartree
(3) subroutine pot_grad(x1d, pot, grad1d): calculate the potential and gradient simultaneously (which will be slightly faster
    than calculating them separately). x1d and pot are the same as those in getpot(), and grad1d is the calculated gradient,
    in hartree/bohr

The get.f90 is an example program to show how to use our PES to calculate the energy and gradient, given the Cartesian
coordinate of a geometry. Use the Makefile to compile the program, and run
./get.x linear_min.xyz
The expected energy is -551.60414294 hartree, and the expect gradients are all zero (< 10^-7)
